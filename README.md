Sources for trump funding project (all data from fec.gov), python file for processing the downloaded data (consolidating into excel files, filtering out individuals and committees that weren't contributing to trumps campaign, etc.), img for the project to display on my portfolio website. Data file and tableau packaged workbook are too large for github so if interested in the large files contact me through my website's contact form: https://lydiak22.pythonanywhere.com/contact
